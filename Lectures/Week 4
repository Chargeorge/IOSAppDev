Lesson 4 

Review of concepts

More on functions
- Inline function
- Variable function

var x = function (a){
	DO SOMETHING
};

Why?  

Because now we can pass functions around.  The best way to do this is to use events.  We will get into events more

document.getElementById("Something").onclick = x;

Similaly , you can just do an Anonomyous function 


document.getElementById("Something").onclick = function(){
	DO STUFF
};

SCOPE:   computer only knows a few things.  Scope lets us work with them.this

SCOPE is a weird concept.  Basic. idea, yuou can only use the thing in the blocks.

SCOPE levels: 

Member (variables and functions)
Global (what we've been mostly using)
Local (Lives in a function)

Why does this matter?  

ConfusioN! For example, 

when doing loops I reuse the variable "i" a lot.  without scope, I couldn't safely reuse it!
Computer uses it: Scope is how the language knows how to use itself


Go back to your homework assignment, and and convert all the functions into function variables.  


Debugging lesson:

Break points: 
Inspection
HTML / CSS inspection
using the console 
using console.log

Loops:

For




- Anonymous function
